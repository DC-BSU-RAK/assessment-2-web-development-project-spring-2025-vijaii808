    <!-- ü•¶ Nutrition Introduction -->
    <section class="nutrition-intro">
      <p>
        Balanced nutrition is not just about eating the right foods ‚Äî it's about creating a lifestyle that is supportive of your physical, emotional, and mental well-being.
        We truly believe here at our medical center that food is one of the most powerful medicines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team of expert dietitians and nutritionists has worked hard to craft a collection of easy-to-follow meal plans and daily tips tailored for all kinds of health goals.
        Whether you're managing chronic conditions like diabetes, aiming for weight loss, recovering from an illness, or just striving to feel more energetic and focused ‚Äî we‚Äôve got you covered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Find healthy recipes, learn to balance your plate, and learn the facts about daily food myths,
        and find advice that fits your life ‚Äî not someone else's. From plant-based diets and low-carb to heart-healthy meals and immunity boosters,
      our guidance is practical, personal, and rooted in science.
      </p>
      <p>
        Begin on a small scale, and then keep to that level of doing while savoring every bitesize. Functional food should not make you feel as if you are being punished for your indulgences.
        It is really about the self-care, delight, and giving strength to the body.üå±üçé
