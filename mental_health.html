    <!-- 💬 Introduction Section: Human-centered explanation of your services -->
    <section class="mental-health-intro">
      <p>
        Hey — we are fully aware of the fact that mental health requires as much attention as physical health do. This is exactly the reason for the creation of a platform that addresses the issue of mental health of all, regardless of the generation gap, in a simple and humane way.
       Parent or child, man or woman, young or old – anyone, who is in any kind of trouble, can come and find ease and get better.
        Whether you are just a parent who is concerned about your kid, someone challenged by the mental health issue, or you are just feeling lost — you are all welcome and not alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our service starts with a warm, professional evaluation. We take the time to understand what you're going through — not just on the surface, but deeply — by listening,
        asking the right questions, and reviewing your history. No judgment. Just support.
      </p>
      <p>
        From there, we create a treatment plan that fits your life. It might include therapy, medication, support groups, or just regular check-ins. Whatever it is,
        it's designed specifically for YOU — not some one-size-fits-all system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team includes kind-hearted professionals — psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists — all working together to make sure you’re supported at every step.
        You’ll also get help understanding your condition, your rights, and what recovery can look like for you and your loved ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most importantly, this is a safe place. Your dignity, privacy, and comfort matter here. You deserve care without fear, shame, or stigma.

    <!-- 🇦🇪 Section about UAE Mental Health Law -->
    <section class="uae-mental-health-law">
      <h2>🇦🇪 Understanding Mental Health Rights in the UAE</h2>
      <p>
        The UAE has stepped up in a big way to protect mental health. There's now a dedicated law that makes sure people struggling with mental health challenges are treated with care,
        dignity, and safety — not with shame or silence.
      </p>
      <p>
        This law sets the rules for how psychiatric care should be provided — from hospitals to clinics and even in special zones.
        It makes sure mental health services are approved, licensed, and properly managed so that people receive only the best and safest care.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also explains how people can be admitted to a hospital (voluntarily or under specific conditions), how to handle emergency cases,
        and what happens if someone leaves or passes away while in care — all while keeping the person’s well-being at the center.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most importantly, it protects patients from harm and ensures their rights are respected. It’s about healing, not punishment.
      </p>
